# Industrial Copper Modeling:

## INTRODUCTION:

The Industrial Copper Modeling project focuses on predicting the selling price and status (won or lost) in the industrial copper market using machine learning regression and classification algorithms. By exploring the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and applying various machine learning techniques, we aim to develop models that can accurately predict the selling price and status in the copper market.
## INFERENCE:

**1.Exploring Skewness and Outliers:**
Analyze the distribution of variables in the dataset and identify skewness and outliers. This step helps in understanding the data quality and potential issues that may affect the model performance.

**2.Data Transformation and Cleaning:**
Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis and perform necessary cleaning steps. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**3.Machine Learning Regression Algorithms:**
Apply various machine learning regression algorithms to predict the selling price of industrial copper. Compare the performance of algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

**4.Machine Learning Classification Algorithms:**
Apply different machine learning classification algorithms to predict the status (won or lost) of copper transactions. Explore algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or random forests to classify the outcomes.

**5.Evaluation and Model Selection:**
Evaluate the performance of regression and classification models using appropriate metrics such as    mean squared error (MSE), accuracy, precision, and recall. Select the best-performing models based on these metrics.
## TOOLS REQUIREMENTS:
* NumPy: A library for numerical computations in Python.
* Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides various regression and classification algorithms.
* Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
* Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.

## METHODOLOGY:

1. **Data Loading:**
   Load the industrial copper dataset using the pandas library and conduct an initial exploration to grasp its structure and contents.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   Tackle missing values, eliminate outliers if required, and execute essential data transformations such as encoding categorical variables. This phase ensures the data is appropriately formatted for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Utilize pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to delve into the dataset. Examine various variables, their distributions, and correlations. Visual aids like histograms, scatter plots, or box plots will be generated to extract insights from the data.

4. **Machine Learning Regression:**
   Employ diverse machine learning regression algorithms to forecast the selling price of industrial copper. Segment the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, and assess their performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).

5. **Machine Learning Classification:**
   Employ distinct machine learning classification algorithms to anticipate the outcome (won or lost) of copper transactions. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, and evaluate their efficacy using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

6. **Documentation:**
   Prepare thorough documentation summarizing the analysis steps, encompassing preprocessing methods, machine learning algorithms employed, and their performance evaluations. Incorporate visualizations and interpretations to effectively communicate the findings.

## Conclusion:
The objective of the Industrial Copper Modeling project is to utilize machine learning techniques for forecasting the selling price and transaction outcomes in the industrial copper market.
